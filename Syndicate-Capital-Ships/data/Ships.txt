	description `The Syndicate Fortress is the Protector's oversized brother, designed to lay down a field of fire that even the most agile fighters and interceptors cannot weave through. Coupled with its impressive physical bulk, multiple shield generators, a compliment of fighters to rival a Navy Carrier, and a layered anti-missile defense screen, it makes an ideal central defense point for merchant or anti-pirate fleets, and is especially popular in planetary defense. The builders do their best to gloss over its primary drawback, the complete lack of engines beyond simple manuevering thrusters.`

	description `The Harbinger is a capital ship upsizing of Syndicated Systems' Vanguard, designed to chew apart pirate fleets and bases alike. Like the Vanguards its modeled after, it focuses on powerful fixed guns and even incorporates a centrally mounted experimental upgrade to the well known Proton Gun. Pirates who mistake it for a the Vanguard they're used to will be for quite a shock from not only its higher firepower and range, but also the improvements to its defenses and agility.`
